# 🌟 MINDMATE.AI

## 🚀 Overview

Our project aims to develop an application that utilizes various modalities such as text, speech, and facial emotion recognition to analyze and collect user data. The ultimate goal is to create a chatbot and virtual counselor capable of providing personalized recommendations to users to help overcome mental health issues. The application utilizes state-of-the-art models including BERT for text analysis, DeepSpeech for speech recognition, and CNN for facial emotion recognition.

## 🤖 Models Used

- BERT (for text analysis)
- DeepSpeech (for speech recognition)
- CNN (for facial emotion recognition)
- Hybrid model recommendation system with reinforcement learning

## 💻 Technologies Used

- UI: ReactJS, React Native
- Model: PyTorch
- Backend: Flask
- Database: SQLite

## 🔒 Privacy Preserving Analysis

To ensure user privacy, we implement the following techniques:

- Differential privacy
- Federated learning

## 🔐 Security Measures

To enhance security, the following measures are implemented:

- Encryption
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the backend using Flask and the specified database (SQLite).
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend using npm.
4. Run the application locally.
