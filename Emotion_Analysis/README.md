# EmoTrack: Next-Gen Multimodal Emotion Sensing & Privacy-Preserving Analysis

Welcome to EmoTrack, an advanced emotion tracking system that utilizes multimodal data processing and privacy-preserving analysis techniques. This repository serves as the foundation for the EmoTrack project.

Please note that this repository currently does not contain the entire codebase. Some codes are yet to be added to provide full functionality. We are actively working on adding more features and improvements.

## Features

- Bilingual text analysis for English and Tamil languages
- Real-time emotion detection for text inputs
- Fine-grained emotion recognition for nuanced emotions
- Visual representation of detected emotions using emojis, GIFs, and color-coded visualizations
- Privacy-preserving techniques including data anonymization, encryption, and differential privacy

## Usage

Once the complete codebase is added, instructions for usage will be provided here.
